Do you remember the historical Zork game? 
What would happen if get it's aesthetics and some core mechanics and insert them in an MMO game?

Probably the idea doesn't make sense but I'm a big fan of retro aesthetics and with some effort on the game design I might develop a nostalgic feeling on some players without excluding young techies as new mechanics are being implemented.
